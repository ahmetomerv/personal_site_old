<h2 class="main-header">About me</h2>
<p>My name is Ahmet Ömer, I work on software development. I live in the Anatolian side of İstanbul. I have worked remotely with multiple clients and as a full-time Frontend Developer, I've worked on software projects in Aksigorta, Omni Pos & Türk Telekom. On Regular basis, I work with JavaScript, Angular, TypeScript, Redux/NgRx, HTML, CSS/SASS and other libraries such as Bootstrap, lodash, Material UI, and more. I also use and know my way around Node, Express, MongoDB, React, Java & Spring. I like to educate myself on technology, programming, data structures, algorithms and network. In my time outside of work, I spend much of my time reading books on Classical era philosophy, Existentialist and Realist literature, and science-fiction. Watching and playing football, listening to The Smiths, Led Zeppelin & watching movies are my other little hobbies.</p>
